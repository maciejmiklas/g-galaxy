This folder contains Backgrounds from [DinVStudio](https://dinvstudio.itch.io/). Artworks cannot be redistributed, but are free to use. Therefore you have to download the file: _Dynamic Space Background FREE.7z_  from [here](https://dinvstudio.itch.io/dynamic-space-background-lite-free)  or [there](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/dynamic-space-background-104175) and 
and extract it into this folder. Afterwards you should have following structure:
